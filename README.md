## IMPORTANT!!!

There is a fork of this module, created by Sourabh Cheedella, that I recommend over using this particular implementation. It is much better featured and supports blocking calls which is a more typical form of communication with robots. (e.g the robot completes it's move before accepting another command)

**Please see mirobot-py here:** [github.com/rirze/mirobot-py](https://github.com/rirze/mirobot-py)

For the time being, I will leave this module as a starting place for people looking to develop their own Mirobot modules as well as to provide an example of how one might communicate asynchronously with a serial device.

Additionally there is the dev branch in this repo (implemented by Blake Hannaford) which supports blocking calls but still supports threaded communication.

Also worth mentioning are the Firmware and ROS repos supplied by WLkata [WLkata Github](https://github.com/wlkata)
## Description

py-mirobot is a python module that can be used to control the [WLkata Mirobot](http://www.wlkata.com/site/index.html)

![Mirobot](/images/Mirobot_Solo_256.jpg)

This component uses the G code protocol to communicate with the Mirobot over a serial connection. The official **G code instruction set** and **driver download** can be found at the [WLkata Download Page](http://www.wlkata.com/site/downloads.html)

## Example Usage

```python
from time import sleep
from mirobot import Mirobot

# create an instance of the Mirobot Class
m = Mirobot(debug=True)
# connect to the com3 port
m.connect('com3')

# wait for the connection
sleep(3)

# start the homing routine
m.home_simultaneous()

# wait for 10 seconds
sleep(10)

# close the connection
m.disconnect()
```

## Communication Methods

- **send_msg(msg)** - Send a serial message.
	- **msg (str)** - The message to send.

- **is_connected()** - Return current connection state.

- **connect(portname, listen_callback=None)** - Open the serial connection.
	- **portname (str)** - The name of the com port to connect to (can be found in the Device Manager in windows)
	- **listen_callback (method)** - A callback method that takes a message arg (e.g. recieve_msg(message)).

- **set_receive_callback(receive_callback)** - Set or change the callback method for received messages.
	- **receive_callback (method)** - A callback method that takes a message arg (e.g. recieve_msg(message)).

- **disconnect()** - Close the serial connection.

## Command Methods

- **home_individual()** - Perform the homing routine on all axes one at a time.

- **home_simultaneous()** - Perform the homing routine on all axes at the same time.

- **set_hard_limit(state)** - Set the hard limit state (True by default). Careful with this one!
	- **state (bool)** - The state to be set.

- **set_soft_limit(state)** - Set the soft limit state (True by default). Careful with this one!
	- **state (bool)** - The state to be set.

- **unlock_shaft()** - Unlock the shaft enabling movement.

- **go_to_zero()** - Send each axis to its 0 position.

- **go_to_axis(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, speed)** - Send each axis to a specific position.
